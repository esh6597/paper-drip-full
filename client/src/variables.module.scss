//This module contains all the same variables as App.scss, but for the
//  sole purpose of exporting for use in other files. This is to keep all
//  custom colors in one readable file so users know the color palette and
//  can change it easily.
//If you're editing these variables, remember to update App.scss as well!
//And vice versa.
