    "about:help": "echo Current suffixes: :help :info :babel :webpack :yarn :react :sass",
    "about:info": "echo Why is everything unnecessarily thorough? && echo These scripts are here to keep track of what the code does in a human-readable way for newbie developers like me. && echo For more information about the package itself, check out the README file!",
    "about:babel": "echo Babel core: main Babel package, a JavaScript compiler && echo Babel client: allows compilation from CLI && echo Env and React: compiles ES6 and JSX respectively into more traditional JavaScript.",
    "about:webpack": "echo Webpack: a module bundler && echo Style, Babel, React, CSS and Sass Loaders: loaders used in Webpack to configure different file types. && echo Note: CSS loader depends on Style loader. Sass loader can use Node Sass as well as Dart, but Dart is more up to date.",
    "about:yarn": "echo Yarn: package manager && echo Yarn was chosen over NPM for front end due to its higher dependency download speed.",
    "about:react": "echo React: UI framework && echo React was chosen due to familiarity. However, it requires :babel and :webpack to properly compile.",
    "about:sass": "echo Dart Sass: a CSS extension language && echo Chosen for Webpack utility and powerful features over plain CSS."
