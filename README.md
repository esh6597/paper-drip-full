# Thanks for checking out Paper Drip!

Paper Drip aims to be an educational website about origami, with the ability
for users to learn from tutorials, buy diagrams and post in forums to discuss
this art form.

This web app is a passion project about origami to help me better cement my
understanding of MERN stack, Sass and more. This repository includes both
client and API packages, but both are licensed identically below.

Currently a work in progress; please check back soon!

# Usage/Documentation

This isn't a newfangled library or anything like that; Paper Drip is just a 
React SPA that includes a store, blog, user accounts, forums and more.

### Current Features/Features in Development:

These are features that were already in the original website or features that
will be added over the course of the next few weeks:

- User account tiers (Standard, Moderator, Author, Admin)
- User login, 3rd party login, user settings
- Visually functional shop and database (no ecommerce support yet)
- About page with ability to contact the site owner
- Blog page that allows approved authors to post to

### Planned Features:

These are features that I intend on adding over the next few months, though
they are all tentative and subject to change.

- Functional shop: eCommerce support
- Forums that make use of the Moderator account tier
- Non-endless pages: overflow pages are hidden or navigable via extra pages
- Newsletter features
- Page search feature via tags and keywords

### Package Scripts
