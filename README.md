# Thanks for checking out Paper Drip!

Paper Drip aims to be an educational website about origami, with the ability
for users to learn from tutorials, buy diagrams and post in forums to discuss
this art form.

This web app is a passion project about origami to help me better cement my
understanding of MERN stack, Sass and more. This repository includes both
client and API packages, but both are licensed identically below.

# Usage/Documentation

This isn't a newfangled library or anything like that; Paper Drip is just a 
React SPA that includes a store, blog, user accounts, forums and more.

### Package Scripts

When running CLIENT-SIDE code, feel free to use the yarn/npm about command
to find out more about the dependencies. You can chain :suffixes for more
information, ex: yarn about:help in bash will display a list of suffixes to use.

Currently a work in progress; please check back soon!
